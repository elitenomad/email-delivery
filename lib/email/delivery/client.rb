=begin
    This class acts like a interface (delegator to provider).
    It will
    - initialize default mail-client(MailGun)
    - call 'do' method to send the emails.
    - provide fail-over mechanism
    - Uses the SendGrid API error codes
        200	OK	Your message is valid, but it is not queued to be delivered. â€ 
        202	ACCEPTED	Your message is both valid, and queued to be delivered.
        400 Bad Request
    - Uses the error codes from MailGun API
        200	Everything worked as expected
        400	Bad Request - Often missing a required parameter
